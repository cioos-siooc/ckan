# Contributing to CKAN Fork

This document will guide you through the process of making contributions. Please take a moment to read through this guide to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**: Before you can contribute, you need to have your own fork of the project.
2. **Clone your fork**: Get a copy of your fork locally so that you can start making changes.
3. **Set up your development environment**: Follow the setup instructions in the README to set up your local environment.

## Contribution Workflow

### Find something to work on

Before starting work, check the issue tracker for existing issues or discussions. If you have a new idea or have found a bug, please open a new issue to discuss it before starting work.

### Determine if the issue is related to CKAN or a CKAN extension

There are many extensions that are a part of this project. If the changes should be made on an extension:

1. **Create or find a related issue in the extension repo**: If none exists within the extension repo and create a branch on it.
2. **Follow the "Making Changes" instructions to make changes in that repo**
3. **Continue within the cioos-siooc/ckan repo to update submodules**

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**: Always work on a new branch rather than the main branch. Create the branch through a Github issue and check it out locally.
2. **Make your changes**: Implement your feature or fix, adhering to the code style and practices used in the project.
3. **Test your changes**: Run the existing tests and add new ones if necessary to cover your changes. Make sure all tests pass.
4. **Document your changes**: Update the README, docstrings, or other documentation as needed to reflect your changes.

### Committing Your Changes

- **Write meaningful commit messages**: Include a brief description of changes made. Start with a short summary (50 characters or less), followed by a detailed description if needed.
- **Commit often**: Smaller, more frequent commits are preferred over one large commit when you finish.

### Pull Requests

1. **Push your changes to your fork**.
2. **Open a pull request**: Target the main repositoryâ€™s relevant branch. Fill in the pull request template, including what your code does and any other relevant details.
3. **Review process**: Maintain an active dialogue if there are any comments or suggestions from the maintainers.

## Coding Standards

- **Code style**: Follow the coding style and conventions used in the project. If available, use linters and formatters to ensure your code conforms to these standards.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that every function is properly documented, following the documentation standards used in the project.
- **Testing**: Aim for thorough test coverage. Include unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.

## Community and Conduct

- **Engage with the community**: Join our community channels (e.g., Slack, forums) if you have not already.
- **Follow our Code of Conduct**: We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.
